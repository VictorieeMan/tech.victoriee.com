## How to subscribe to the feed

I'll aim to reposting some stuff to Medium and Substack. Letting them deal with email lists, comment fields etc. Is easier for me. This site is however the ground truth and the place I'll update first. If any of the following platforms please you, check them out.


### RSS
I'm considering this feature to be implemented, but it's not a priority. Maybe, in the future :)

### Nostr

Also looking into forwarding posts to [https://yakihonne.com](https://yakihonne.com/users/nprofile1qqs05qt95rce97cwj8rasugw2ats45nmxu2u55scrak98jdjqvuhqucpr3mhxue69uhkummnw3ez6vp39eukz6mfdphkumn99e3k7mgpremhxue69uhkummnw3ez6vpj9ejx7unpveskxar0wfujummjvuq3gamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwv3sk6atn9e5k7sf32sh) at the nostr network.
