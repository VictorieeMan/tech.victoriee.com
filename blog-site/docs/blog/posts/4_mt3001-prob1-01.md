# Basic probability theory, MT3001 module 1 / 15

## Introduction
Probability theory is the study of random phenomena. It is used in many fields, such as statistics, machine learning, and finance. It is also used in everyday life, for example when playing games of chance, or when estimating the risk of an event. The most classic example is the coin toss, closely followed by the dice roll.

When we toss a coin the result is either heads or tails. In the case of an ideal coin, the "random trail" of tossing the coin has an equal probability for both outcomes. Similarly, for a die roll of a fair dice we know that the probability for each outcome is 1/6. In the study of probability we dive deep into the mathematics of these random phenomena, how to model them, and how to calculate the probability of different events. To do this in precise terms we define words and concepts as tools for discussing and communicating about the subject.

This is the first of what I expect to be a 15 part series of my lecture & study notes from my university course in probability theory MT3001 at Stockholm University. This first module concerns basic concepts and definitions, needed for the rest of the course.

## Sample space
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. It is denoted $\Omega$.

## Probability
Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the event is impossible, and 1 means that the event is certain.

## Probability space
A probability space is a triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, where $\Omega$ is the sample space, $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of events, and $P$ is the probability measure.
