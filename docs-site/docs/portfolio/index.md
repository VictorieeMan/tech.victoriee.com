<h1>🚧Under construction!👷🏗️</h1>

I'm specializing in the Rust programming language. Quick, fast and well-structured code is the deal. Always learning, always perfecting. I'm especially interested in high performance code, and optimizations. If you got something interesting cooking, connect!

For an interesting enough project I'm willing to work for $4000 / month, otherwise you'll have to bid against my other available opportunities or active employments / contracts.

My specialities:
* The rust programming language, for a multitude of applications.
* Machine Learning with Pytorch.
* CUDA programming, for NVIDIA GPU units.
* App development using Flutter & Rust for really speedy optimized apps.
* Amazon AWS & general webb problem solving and set ups
