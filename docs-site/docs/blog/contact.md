# Contact
To keep things things simple, as I like. You can publicly @ me at [xTwitter.com]([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/VictorieeMan)) for free or privately pay the spam filtering over at my [Vida page](https://vida.page/victorieeman) and I'll get back to you.

I accept both these channels for whatever kind of contact you have in mind, professional or otherwise. Reasons for contact might include: a friendly "hi", consulting questions, inquiry to hire me, expertise or questions about my published content, general inquiries etc.

## Tips & tricks when looking to "Hire me"
Intrigue me with your project and or business, but stay honest and upfront about the essentials. Mainly I'm interested in opportunities that involve working with great people, be it smartness or good vibeness. Salary & or contract payment, is important but mainly to help value where to best spend my energy and time in relation to other opportunities.

### Tips & tricks when looking for help
Ask on @ me on twitter and just ask! If interesting enough and I have time for it, I'm open to some pro bono stuff for minor single time & or very impactful things. Attaching some money to it, would however increase my incentive of course.
