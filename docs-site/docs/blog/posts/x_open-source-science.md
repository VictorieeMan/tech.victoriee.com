# How to open-source science, a proposal
Intro / summary
<!-- more -->

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) research & report repository + website.
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) DOI publishing registrar, with open access.
- [Amazon KDP](https://kdp.amazon.com) self publishing paper copies & e-books.
- [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com) donation tool, make it easy to get crowdfunded in your research.
- Social media, to share your research. Ideally you find a way to reach the appropriate community of interested researches. Suggested platforms are those that let anyone read what's posted like nostr, x.com (twitter), a blog, etc.

## introduction
Some problems of the current model:
- after lots of work, often research papers get locked behind paywalls with money that don't even reach the origianl researchers
- peer-review is only at the end of the process of a long report, while in open-source it's possible to have continious feedback
- collected experimental data gets more easily available, and better proive to out common knowledgebase
- Transparency to research, builds more trust and more efficient faster research like the software devlopers to it
- This proposal is more available even for independent researchers without institutional backing / access
- Open-sourced research science is what science always intended to be, but the process got derailed and centralized by science publications in the ww2 era. Internet cameand software developers embraced the medium, it's now time for the rest of stem to catch up

### The scientific process (system)
- research
- experiments
- community
- paper writing
- peer-review
- universities
- publications

### Academia & Industry

### the history of peer-review

## the case for open-sourced science
Accelerating research like software developers accelerated Machine Learning research. Credit for research is still part of the process. Everything gets timestamped and logged.

## proposed workflow (how to)

## conclusion and further ideas
