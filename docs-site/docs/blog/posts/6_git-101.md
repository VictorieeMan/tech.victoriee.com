# Git 101, the essential commands

The Git version control system, is what puts the "git" in "GitHub". It's the core infrastructure of open-sourced software and in my opinion the best tool for documenting, logging and collaborating on code. In this post, I'll assume that you know what git is and already have it installed on your system; available in your terminal. What follows is a cheat sheet, of what I consider to be some of the most useful commands and how to use them. For a full set of commands please reference the official [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).
